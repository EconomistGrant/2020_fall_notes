compare the consistency of two data sets
First data set is the gathered data of fires, Second is summary statistics

Fundamental structure: unordered_map, hash_table to record and update, when the program encounters a line in the first file, add the number of fires of that region to the year, traverse all lines in first file, each year -> total number of fires in brazil
1. every year match
2. number of year match

Implementation detail:
1. sstream
2. 2 counts: file counts and string counts.
