## How well operationally, it is doing?
Sale Growth, EBIT/Sales, Profit Growth, ROE, ROA
EBIT/Sales is stable: no operating leverage concern?
Profit going fast, sales growth going down?
ROE: stable

## Discrepancy between ROA and ROE
ROA -- ROE up

Asset base growing faster than equity base!
the way you grow asset: account payables
Income grow as fast as asset, but not equity

ROE = ROA * Asset/Equity

when ROA = (1-t) * EBIT / Assets
ROE = ROA + Liab/Equity * (ROA - (1-t)*r)
r = interest / liab : effective interest rate

ROA - (1-t)*r : positive when operation is more profitable than leverage!

## Financing Policy
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest = EBIT/A * A/D * 1/r
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
