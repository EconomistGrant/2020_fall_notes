# Objective
Quantitative forecast of cash-flows
Scenario analysis ("sensitivity") (counterfactuals: "what if")
concept: sustainable growth rate

# Forecasting: rules of the game
Funding Need = delta asset - (delta Liab + delta net_worth)

Pro Forma Statements
Assumptions: 
1. Growth assumptions: growth of asset = growth of sales
2. Constant ratios: inventory / sales, gross margin, AP = x days of COGS...

## Scenarios
a. Sales growth = 25%, A/P collection time = 55 days
b. Sales growth = 25%. A/P collection time = 10 days, 2% purchase discount
c. Sales growth = 14%, A/P collection time = 10 days, 2% purchase discount

## Assumptions:
Cash grows with sales
A/R 12% of sales
PPE grow with sales
Accured Expenses 1.5% of Sales
Inventories, COGS: fixed of Sales

I/Sï¼š operating profit 3% of sales, interest rate on borrowing 13%, t = 20%

## Estimate Loan needs
Bank Loan = Assets - (Liabilities + Net Worth)
