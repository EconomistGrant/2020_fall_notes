# Central Limit Theorem
distribution of the sum/average of Independent RVs, will appear normal when n -> inf
return is normally distributed

lag normal distribution?

# Expected Return and risk
expected: average
take arithmetic not geometric

# Expected Utility and Certianty Equivalent
utility increase as the log of wealth
risk averse

ln(C) = Pr ln(Win) + (1-Pr) ln (Lose)

# Compound
make expected return weird
think about 0.5 chance +25%. 0.5 changce -5%, two period
expected return of 1 period: 10%; 2 periods: 21%

because of compounding: returns are log normally distributed

# Higher Moments

# Time Diversification
fallacy: risk goes down with time
20 year investment rather than 1 year: more willing to take risk?

coin: win, 1/3 gain; loss, 1/4 loss
expected wealth going up but expected utility is the same

The probability of losing decreases, but the amount you can lose increases, they are exactly offsetting

# Optimization
compute marginal utility of each asset -> all marginal utility equals
move money from lower marginal to higher marginal

10 year, find one per year
rank on a scale of 0 - 100
no revert, end of yr 10 no chance

expectation in yr 10 is 50:
at year 9, if more than 50, go
hurdle of year 9: 0.5 * 75 + 0.5 * 50 = 62.5
going backward...

Sub-optimality Cost vs. Rebalancing Cost, decide to rebalance?
