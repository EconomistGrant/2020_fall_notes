Arbitrage Pricing

# Payoff Matrix Review
arbitrage 1: buy something for nothing
arbitrage 2: sell nothing and get something for it

The rank of payoff matrix: number of independent columns
(a column is a security)
(a row is a state)

A: [bond stock call#1 call#2]
## Linearity
A(c1x1 + c2x2) = c1(Ax1) + c2(Ax2)
given portfolio, A: R4 -> R3

## Reverse
what portfolio has payoff (0 1 1)T
Ax = b -> x = A-1 b? if invertible (no redundant)

### Complete market
every payoff can be generated by some portfolio
Image(A) = full space
kernal of A (Az = 0)
### rank
rank(A) = rank(AT) <= min(n,s)
rank(AB) <= min(rA, rB)
r(AAT) = r(A)

### Redundant Securities
can be replicated by others: option
not unique solution

# Prices
position * price vector
S^T x = X^T S = S * x = S[x]
S : Rn -> R

prices * [inverse of payoff matrix] = state prices
[]: the positions you need to replicate

# Arbitrage 
## Type 1
buy something for nothing 
Sx <= 0, Ax >= 0, at least one component/payoff >0


A = 1 3  S = 1
    1 2      1
    1 1a

x = -1   Sx = 0, Ax = (2, 1, 0)^T
     1              

Arbitrage can be avoided if Sx > 0
stock dominates bond, and price must be higher
but mathematically?

## Type 2
get money for a portfolio with zero payoff
Ax = 0, Sx != 0

# Law of One Price
1. No arbitrage
2. unique price

prices linear in assets and asset prices
