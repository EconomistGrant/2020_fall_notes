# Financial Engineering
application of finance principles and relevant tools to arrive at concrete solutions to the specific problems in meeting these challenges

cover well-settled and frontier of FE

Mende: abritrage pricing and applications
       continuous-time finance, stochastic calculus, modelling

Kogan: optimization, equilibrium without/with frictions

# Probablities and Payoffs: warmup examples
fair: xi = 1/pi - 1
write x = n/d, "n-to-d:

bookmaker: pi = -xiBi + sumBj       if i happens

if demand is 2 to 1:
x1 = B2/B1 = 1/2  (-x1B1 + B2 = 0) (B: wager that people put in) (x1: addtional payoff for people win)
x2 = B1/B2 = 2    (-x2B2 + B1 = 0)

implied probability: p1 = 67%, p2 = 33%

## Modify payoff
x1 - pi/Bi

use implied probability rather than true prob: win the same amount everytime, despite that the expectation is the same

arrange payoff to let people gambling with information...let them have the risk
Professor don't bear the risk of models?

# Model in Finance
idealize a lot of things
throw away details

## good models
reproduce observed behaviors qualitively/quantitively, limit, well-defind range, allow for corrections/extensions

## Model breakdown
knowing how model fails is just as important as knowing where and when they are no longer valid
model assumption

# Payoff Matrix
Payoff Matrix * positions
